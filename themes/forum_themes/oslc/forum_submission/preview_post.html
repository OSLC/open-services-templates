	    For future people, here's all the processing that goes into this little post_body tag:
	    1. On submission, some tags are stripped for security.
	    2. Content is converted according to the following settings:
	      - Security conversion: Add-ons > Modules > Forums > Forum Management > [forum name] > Edit > Text and HTML formatting HTML Formatting in Posts (set to "Allow All" [probably])
	      - Markdown conversion: Add-ons > Modules > Forums > Forum Management > [forum name] > Edit > Text and HTML formatting Text Formatting in Posts (set to "Smartdown")
	    3. Check my extension exp.oslc_wiki_markdown_fixes for additional "fixes"
	      - Un-encodes some brackets for Markdown Extra header IDs
	      - Un-encodes some double-encoded characters in code blocks
	  --}
